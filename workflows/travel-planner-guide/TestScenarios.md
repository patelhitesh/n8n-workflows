Hampi is the glorious capital of the Vijayanagara Empire, and Pattadakal consists of Hindu and Jain temples from the 7th and 8th centuries.      | This directly tests the chatbot's ability to extract specific, key facts about designated heritage sites.         |

More specifically, Dandeli is highlighted for its lush green forests post-monsoon, and the Malnad region (which Agumbe is part of) also suggests post-monsoon from September to March for lush greenery and a cool nip in the air. | This tests the ability to combine information from multiple destinations within a circuit based on user preferences (duration, activity types) and provide relevant seasonal advice. |
| Context-Based Test| Where can I find the 'Malgudi Days' house, and what kind of experience can I expect there?              | The famous TV serial ‘Malgudi Days’ was shot across the Agumbe region.
