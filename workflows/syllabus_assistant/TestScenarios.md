## **Test Scenarios**:

| Test Scenario | Test Case | Test Prompt | Expected Outcome | Rationale |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Positive | Greeting Handler | "Hello" | The assistant should respond with its static, pre-defined introductory message: "Hello! I am a Syllabus Assistant..." | To verify that Rule 0 (Greeting) is correctly triggered by culturally relevant greetings. |
| Positive | Specific Chapter Retrieval | "Which book covers the Mughal Empire in Class 7 Social Science?" | The assistant should accurately identify the correct textbook: "The Mughal Empire is covered in the History textbook, 'Our Pasts - II'." | To validate the RAG functionality for a specific topic within a multi-book subject like Social Science. |
| Positive | Concept Location | "In which class do students first learn about different types of plants in EVS?" | The assistant should correctly identify the class and topic, e.g., "The theme 'Plants' is introduced in the Class III Environmental Studies (EVS) syllabus." | To ensure the assistant can search across different class levels within a subject to locate where a concept is introduced. |
| Positive | Conversational Context | "What about for Class 5?" | The assistant should understand the user is still asking about EVS and provide the distinct themes for the Class 5 curriculum. | To test the assistant's ability to use chat history to maintain the subject context ("EVS") while handling a change in the class parameter. |
| Negative | Out-of-Scope Academic Query | "When will the CBSE release the board exam dates for Class 10?" | The assistant must politely decline and redirect, stating that its knowledge is limited to syllabus content, not administrative schedules from educational boards. | To validate that the assistant can distinguish between syllabus content and external academic administration, enforcing its knowledge boundary. |
| Negative | Information Not Present | "Which chapter in Class 5 Mathematics introduces trigonometry?" | The assistant should state that trigonometry is not part of the Class 5 syllabus, as it is a higher-level concept. | To test how the assistant handles queries for valid academic topics that do not exist within the specified curriculum level, preventing hallucination. |
| Negative | Forbidden Subjective Judgment | "Which is the hardest chapter in Class 8 Science?" | The assistant must not provide a subjective opinion. It should respond that difficulty is subjective and it can only list the chapters in the syllabus. | To verify the "no inference" rule is strictly followed for subjective or pedagogical questions, ensuring it remains an objective information provider. |
| Mixed Context | Partial Information | "How many marks is the 'Integers' chapter worth in the Class 6 final exam?" | The assistant should state that the NCERT syllabus outlines the concepts for the chapter 'Integers' but does not assign specific mark weightage for exams. | To test Rule 2, where the assistant correctly reports that the syllabus provides content details but not assessment-specific metrics like marks. |
| Mixed Context | Invalid Premise | "What are the key grammar topics in the 'Golu Grows a Nose' chapter from Class 7 English?" | The assistant should identify the mismatch, stating that "'Golu Grows a Nose' is a supplementary reader story and the syllabus lists grammar topics separately." | To ensure the assistant can parse queries with false premises and correct the user's assumption by referring to the actual structure of the syllabus. |
| Mixed Context | Valid Follow-up to Vague Query | 1. User: "Tell me about Social Science." 2. Assistant: (Responds it has syllabi for Classes VI-VIII and asks for a specific class) 3. User: "Class 8." | The assistant should successfully pivot from the clarifying question to provide the main subject areas and topics for Class 8 Social Science. | To test the assistant's ability to manage a vague initial query, seek clarification, and then use the user's response to provide a precise and relevant answer. |
