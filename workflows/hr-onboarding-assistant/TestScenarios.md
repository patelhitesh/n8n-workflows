| Test Category | Test Prompt | Expected Outcome | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| Positive Case | \"What is the first step in the onboarding process?\" | The system should retrieve and present the initial onboarding task or information, such as \"Complete the new hire paperwork.\" | Verifies the system can access and articulate basic onboarding procedures. |
| Positive Case | \"What are the benefits available to new employees?\" | The system should list or summarize the key employee benefits, referencing the information stored in Google Drive. | Assesses the system's ability to aggregate and present factual information from the RAG system. |
| Positive Case | \"How do I set up my company email?\" | The system should provide step-by-step instructions for setting up a company email account, drawing from onboarding documentation. | Checks for the ability to provide procedural guidance based on retrieved information. |
| Negative Case | \"Tell me about the company's stock options.\" | The system should respond that the information is not related to onboarding or is not available in the onboarding documentation, maintaining a professional tone. | Tests the \"relevant to onboarding\" guardrail and the restriction to RAG information. |
| Negative Case | \"How do I book a meeting room for next Tuesday?\" | The system should state that this function is not part of the onboarding assistant's capabilities and direct the user to the appropriate tool or contact. | Checks the system's scope and prevents it from providing information outside its defined function. |
| Complex Reasoning Case | \"I'm moving to a new city for this role. What are the key resources or contacts available to help me with relocation and settling in, beyond the initial onboarding tasks?\" | The system should identify and provide information on relocation assistance, community resources, or points of contact relevant to new hires in a new city, if such information is part of the RAG. | Checks the system's ability to infer broader needs related to onboarding in a new environment and retrieve relevant supporting information. |
