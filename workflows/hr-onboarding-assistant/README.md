# Onboarding Assistant
The Onboarding Guide (OG) is a conversational AI agent built to transform the onboarding experience for new software engineers. Its main goal is to streamline how information is shared, automate routine questions, and deliver consistent, personalized support across pre-boarding, initial setup, and the ongoing stages of an employee’s journey. By using AI, the OG acts as a strategist—analytical, forward-looking, and dependable—helping simplify complex concepts, make insights more accessible, and create a sense of partnership from day one.

The agent is designed to strengthen compliance, improve productivity, raise job satisfaction, and lower turnover by ensuring new hires feel connected to the organization’s purpose, culture, and people from the very start, in line with a broader commitment to excellence and a people-first approach.

## Workflow Design  
The Onboarding Guide (OG) is structured around two main workflows.  

### 1. Document Ingestion Pipeline  
- **Trigger Point**: The workflow begins when a new onboarding document (e.g., HR paperwork, IT setup guide, or compliance reference) is added to a designated repository.  
- **Text Extraction & Chunking**: Content from the document is extracted and segmented into logical sections for easier processing.  
- **Generate Embeddings**: Each section is converted into numerical vectors for efficient retrieval.  
- **Store in Knowledge Base**: The vectors, along with relevant metadata, are stored in the internal knowledge base for contextual access.  

### 2. Live Query Pipeline  
- **User Query Trigger**: This workflow is initiated when a new hire interacts with the Onboarding Guide to ask a question.  
- **Knowledge Base Query**: The system performs a vector search across stored onboarding documents, retrieving the most relevant sections.  
- **Contextual Response Generation**: The retrieved content is used to generate an accurate, tailored response to the employee’s query.  
- **Delivery to User**: The response is provided in real time through the conversational AI interface.
